# 🚀 **Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) Technique**

## 🔍 **What is ROP?**

**Return-Oriented Programming (ROP)** is an advanced exploitation technique that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary operations on a program by chaining together small sequences of instructions, called **gadgets**, already present in the program's executable memory. These gadgets typically end with a `ret` (return) instruction, which enables seamless chaining of operations.

## 📜 **How Does ROP Work?**

1. **⚠️ Exploiting Vulnerabilities**  
   ROP usually starts with a vulnerability, such as a buffer overflow, that allows overwriting the stack. This leads to hijacking the program's control flow.

2. **🔗 Finding Gadgets**  
   Gadgets are small sequences of code that perform tasks like `mov`, `call`, or `add`. Tools like `ROPgadget` help identify gadgets within the binary or linked libraries.

3. **🧩 Chaining Gadgets**  
   Attackers craft a payload that places the addresses of these gadgets on the stack in a specific sequence. When executed, the `ret` instruction at the end of each gadget transitions control to the next gadget in the chain.

4. **🔨 Achieving Execution**  
   By chaining gadgets, attackers can mimic desired functions, bypassing security measures like **Data Execution Prevention (DEP)** or leveraging writable and executable memory regions.
